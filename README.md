# Enterprise Software Development - Vision Care UML Diagrams
Enterprise Software Development refers to the process of creating software applications or systems specifically tailored for large organizations or enterprises to meet their unique business
needs. These software solutions are designed to support and streamline various business functions, processes, and workflows within an organization. There are some key characteristics
and considerations associated with enterprise software development; they are scalability, security, integration, performance, reliability, compliance, cost-effectiveness, and many more.
There are major five categories in enterprise software and they are Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, Human Resource
Management Systems (HRMS), Business Intelligence (BI) tools, and Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems. Enterprise software requires careful planning, a deep understanding of the business processes it supports, and a commitment to delivering reliable, scalable, and secure software.

The requirements of one of the large-scale businesses will be gathered, processed, and designed as the outcome of this project. Using methods and diagrams which are used most frequently by
software developers to handle the requirements. Diagrams are drawn by software which are specific for drawing UML diagrams. Databases, customers, employees, and inventories play major roles in large-scale companies. Handling these databases and others by manpower is very hard. So companies use software to andle their databases, customers, employees, and inventories. We selected a Large-scale Non- profit Organization, Vision Care as our resource.
